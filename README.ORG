#+TITLE: bqn-mode

* Synopsis

Emacs major mode for BQN programming language.

Extracted from the original [[https://github.com/mlochbaum/BQN][BQN]] repository
and independently maintained since approx. 2021.

Before that, bqn-mode was derived and heavily based on the venerable
[[https://github.com/lokedhs/gnu-apl-mode][gnu-apl-mode]].

* Installing bqn-mode

** From sources

After =git clone= this repository, you can just add the following snippet to you
=init.el= file:

#+begin_src lisp
(add-to-list 'load-path "~/path/to/bqn-mode")
(require 'bqn-mode)
#+end_src

** From MELPA

bqn-mode is available on [[https://melpa.org/#/bqn-mode][MELPA]].

1. Configure your =package-archives= to include MELPA.

2. You can now use the typical =M-x list-packages= interface to find and install
   =bqn-mode=.

* Fonts

BQN uses a peculiar set of symbols, not always available on the default fonts of
major operating systems. Nonetheless there are many fonts available around the
Web. Here are some links:
