      "+"

      ["Monad: Conjugate | Dyad: Addition | Input: +"

       "+ is a function.
  Its monadic form conjugates.
  Its dyadic form is addition.
  Can be applied to numbers, arrays and characters. For characters, uses an
    affine space relative to the linear space of numbers. Thus, 'a' + 2 is valid
    but 'a' + 'b' is not."
